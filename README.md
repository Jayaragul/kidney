# Kidney Disease Prediction App

This project is a **machine learning-based web app** designed to predict the likelihood of kidney disease based on certain health parameters. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals and patients in identifying potential kidney issues early, ensuring timely intervention.

The app takes various health parameters as input, analyzes them using a trained machine learning model, and provides a prediction indicating whether the patient is in **good condition** or at **risk of kidney disease**.
